# HNG Stage 1 â€“ Multi-Page Web Application

This is the continuation of my **Stage 0 Profile Card** project.  
Stage 1 extends the original single-page component into a **multi-page, accessible, responsive website** with two new pages â€” a **Contact Form** and an **About Me** page â€” built using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

---

## âœ¦ Overview

The project now includes three connected pages:

1. **Home / Profile Page** â€“ the Stage 0 profile card.  
2. **Contact Page** â€“ a form with validation and success/error handling.  
3. **About Page** â€“ a reflective write-up structured with semantic sections.

Navigation links connect all three for a seamless user flow.
