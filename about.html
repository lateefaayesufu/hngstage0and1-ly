                        heyyy!
                        my journey into tech wasn't linear—it started with curiosity, grew through late-night debugging sessions, 
                        and solidified when i realized i could build things that actually matter. i'm drawn to the intersection 
                        of design and engineering, where functionality meets aesthetics. when i'm not coding, you'll find me 
                        experimenting with generative art, chasing perfect light in landscape photography, or debating whether 
                        dark mode is objectively superior (it is). ★ˎˊ˗

                        heyy future me! remember this moment. remember the imposter syndrome, the late nights wondering if you're 
                        "good enough," and the fear of failing publicly. remember that growth happens in discomfort, and that 
                        every senior engineer you admire was once exactly where you are now. by the time you're reading this, 
                        you've either pushed through or learned something valuable from not pushing through. either way, you're 
                        further along than you are today. keep building. keep learning. Keep showing up, even when it's hard. 
                        and for the love of all that's holy, please remember to document your code better. your teammates (and 
                        future you) will thank you. also, that bug you're stressing about right now? you'll fix it. you always do.

                    <p>
                        i believe the best code is the code you never have to write. simplicity is criminally underrated in this 
                        industry. also, i'm convinced that 80% of software problems could be solved with better communication and 
                        proper sleep schedules (we really need to stop glorifying burnout). i'm passionate about accessibility—not 
                        as an afterthought, but as a fundamental part of good design. i think dark mode is objectively superior 
                        (yes, i'm repeating this because it's scientifically proven, probably). i love collaborative debugging 
                        sessions more than solo coding marathons because two brains are genuinely better than one. and finally, 
                        I think the tech industry desperately needs more people who care about the "why" as much as the "how." 
                        let's build things that matter, not just things that work. let's make the web more accessible, more 
                        beautiful, and more human. that's the kind of engineer I want to be.
